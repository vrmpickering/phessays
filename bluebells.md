# Bluebells

The English bluebell has petals that create a tubular-bell-shape with rolled back tips. These are strongly scented, sweet flowers and most often appear in the colour of a deep violet-blue but sometimes they can be pink or white. The flowers tend to be on one side of the stem which causes them to droop over, like a shepherd’s crook.

In the UK, bluebells are famously known for the incredible carpet of colour they produce in woodland areas. Originally native to western Europe (in deciduous woodlands), bluebells are known to grow wild in Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Portugal, and Spain. The bluebell has also been introduced into Germany, Italy and Romania and even transported across the Atlantic where it grows in a few places in North America. Almost half of the Bluebell global population though, is found in the UK where it flowers between late April and early May.

Other names for the bluebell include Nodding Squill, Wood Bells, Auld Man’s Bells, Dead Men’s Bells, and Wild Hyacinth. Formally known as Scilla nutans, and then Endymion non-scriptus, the botanical name for bluebells is currently Hyacinthoides non-scripta, as described by Carl Linneaus in his Species Plantarum, published in 1753. The English bluebell discussed here belongs to the genus Hyacinthoides which includes only eleven species.

##History of Use
Bluebells are most often found in woodlands where they are able to avoid the trampling hooves of livestock, and thrive in the moist conditions provided under a woodland canopy. Bluebells are very slow to colonise new habitats though. In the 1960s, Belgium undertook a long-term experiment to measure this rate in more accuracy. Bluebells were transplanted to 27 new areas and then measured in 2005 and 2006. It appeared that more than four decades after their planting, only half of the new populations appeared to have survived and were spreading. The botanists were able to calculate from this data that in the next 45 years, the main population of bluebells would spread by only another 14 metres, or 45 feet. In other words, because British woodlands have been in existence since at least 1600 AD, and bluebells take a long time to establish themselves in new areas, bluebells are often used as an important environmental indicator of ancient woodland. 

Other uses of the bluebell relate to glue, medicine and tourism. Historically, glue has been extracted from bluebells and used to stick feathers to arrows. Bluebell sap was used to bind the spines of books and because it was toxic, this prevented insects and other pests from attacking the bindings. 

In the thirteenth-century manuscript, bluebells were mentioned for their part in curing leprosy but unlike many of the other plants found in the Plant Humanities Workbench, bluebells are rarely found described in herbals. Bluebells have been used as a diuretic as well as in medicine to treat leucorrhoea (discharge of mucus from the vagina). More recently, the defensive chemicals found in bluebells have been attracting interest from pharmacologists. Fifteen biologically active chemicals have been isolated from bluebells, two of which appear to be similar to chemicals extracted from members of the pea family and which may have important effects on HIV and cancer cells.

In 2002, the charity Plantlife officially declared the bluebell as Britain’s favourite flower. The woodland bluebell carpet however, has always been a favourite attraction. As Emily Bronte wrote in the nineteenth century:

The Bluebell is the sweetest flower
That waves in summer air:
Its blossoms have the mightiest power
To soothe my spirit's care.

Emily's sister, Anne, would also write a poem about bluebells:

There is a silent eloquence
In every wild bluebell
That fills my softened heart with bliss
That words could never tell…

For Canon H.D. Rawnsley, bluebells could even lessen the horrors of the trenches in World War I (May 1916):

Yet so potent is the spell of the bluebell slope on this
Gorgeous Maytide afternoon, that at times, though it be 
For a few moments, we can forget the horrors of battle,
And can feel in tune with the ‘cloud-born stream’ with
‘each tumultuous working left behind’.

The role of bluebells in British tourism increased particularly in the twentieth century. 'Bluebell Trains' took visitors on trips to see the remarkable displays in the deciduous woodlands of the Chiltern Hills in southeast England for example. This area would later become designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) where the bluebells continue to appear every year. 
While the rich nectar of bluebells provides food for butterflies and other insects, it is important to remember that they also contain toxic glycosides. In fact, humans can be poisoned if the bulbs are mistaken for spring onions and eaten. Cattle, horses and dogs have been reported to suffer digestive problems after eating bluebell leaves.

##The future of Bluebells
In 1981, the UK prohibited the digging up of bluebell bulbs from the countryside, thereby banning the removal of bluebells for sale. This was the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981). In 1998, the trade of wild bluebell bulbs and seeds became an offence with the exception of special government-issued licences for the sustainable collection of seeds.

However, a range of issues provide a current and future threat to the future of the bluebell. For example, the loss of ancient woodland habitat, the illegal collection of bulbs, as well as the cross-breeding of non-native bluebells. 

Non-native bluebells (Hyacinthoides hispanica and numerous Hyacinthoides hybrids and cultivars) have apparently escaped from cultivation and may pose a threat to British H. non-scripta populations. Spanish bluebells grow wild in the Iberian Peninsula and were thought to have been brought to British gardens in the late seventeenth century. More vigorous than the native bluebell and able to spread much faster, the Spanish bluebell was recorded growing in the wild in 1909. Scientists at the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh are studying native and non-native bluebells in the wild to evaluate the actual threats to H. non-scripta.

The Climate also poses a major threat to the bluebell. If you visit Kew Gardens’ Conservation Area (near Queen Charlotte's Cottage), you will discover a ‘thick carpet of nodding, fragrant bluebells stretching away into the distance under the trees’ capturing ‘the very essence of English woodland in springtime, alive with the drone of bumblebees, birdsong and the first butterflies, all making the most of the warm sunshine.’ Bluebells have long been grown in the natural areas at Kew and for fifty years, experts at Kew have been recording the first flowering dates of plants in the Gardens. This work, or phenology, allows connections to be made between the timing of events, such as flowering, with the weather. Such studies are incredibly valuable for tracking the effects of climate change on plants and animals. The results from Kew’s studies indicate that the dates on which the first bluebells open can vary by several weeks from year to year depending on the severity of the preceding winter. The average opening dates taken over five yearly periods have advanced by as much as two weeks over the last 30 years, corresponding to the period during which scientists believe that man-made climate change has accelerated. In other words, spring is arriving earlier and earlier.

Such a rising difficulty in the ability to predict when the peak time for bluebells will be each year signals an important warning for their future. Almost 50% of the world's bluebells occur in the UK and they are superbly adapted to burst into leaf and flower on the woodland floor before other woodland plants have come into leaf to cover the ground, and in advance of the foliage overhead forming a dense canopy. It appears that different plants respond to climate change at different rates and the warming climate enables other plants to make an earlier start as well. Although bluebells are appearing above ground earlier in the year, their emerging leaves are finding an increasingly crowded environment and one that is more heavily shaded by the tree canopy above. It is widely feared that our bluebells are suffering as a result. 

##The future of bluebells
The Millennium Seed Bank Partnership focuses on plants under threat and those of most use in the future. Seeds are dried, packaged and stored at a sub-zero temperature in our seed bank vault. Collections of Hyacinthoides non-scripta seeds have been made an are held in Kew's Millennium Seed Bank based at Wakehurst in West Sussex.
In Britain, it is important to plant the true native bluebell ( Hyacinthoides non-scripta ) and not the Spanish bluebell ( H. hispanica ), as this is often more vigorous and can take over the garden, out-competing native bluebell populations. It can also hybridise with the native bluebell, and could ultimately destroy the pure species.
Alcohol-preserved specimens of Hyacinthoides non-scripta are held in Kew's Herbarium, where they are available to researchers by appointment. The details of some of these specimens can be seen online in Kew's Herbarium Catalogue.
